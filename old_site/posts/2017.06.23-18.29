##Hello World! | 2017 06 23

So I finally got around to creating some kind of website and, as I'm sure is obvious, I did pretty much the bare minimum. I don't much care for more complex websites and I've always been a fan of [Stallman's](https://stallman.org/) sans the clutter. This whole thing is just a single HTML file with three lines of CSS, these posts are generated via [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) from markdown. The whole thing is then wrapped in a python script to easily manage the multiple files, and tacking on the header / footer. Not sure why I never thought of this before.
