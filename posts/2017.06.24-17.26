##Managing \__all__ in Python | 2017 06 24

I recently had some issues organizing a Python [project](https://github.com/aanunez/tortilla8). I was concerned that `import foo` wasn't including everything an end user would expect and the simple solution of importing everything in `__init__` added a lot of mess (constants and other imports specific to the module) to the the enviorment. The solution is to add `__all__` to every module, which should list all exportable deffinitions. Unfortunitaly, managing `__all__` across multiple modules isn't fun or easy, luckily I stumpled across a lecture by [David Beazley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGYZEKstQuQ) where it is suggested that an `export` decorator be used to build `__all__`.

Placing the below export decorator in `__init__` means that two lines of boiler plate are needed in modules: `__all__ = []` and `from . import export`. This specific version is lifted from stack overflow user [Ed L](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41895077/export-decorator-that-manages-all). Using this you get the behavior one would expect when using `from foo import *` and from `import foo`, everything decorated with export and nothing else.

```python
from sys import modules
def export(defn):
    mod = modules[defn.__module__]
    if hasattr(mod, '__all__'):
        name, all_ = defn.__name__, mod.__all__
        if name not in __all__:
            all_.append(name)
    else:
        mod.__all__ = [defn.__name__]
    return defn
```
