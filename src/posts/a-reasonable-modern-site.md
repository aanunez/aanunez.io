Well after enough tooling and tweaks I think its safe to say the site, sans the Resume which may never actually be added, is done. Looks pretty good on mobile too. The whole point was just to have a nice landing page that I could easily host doc and tool pages on. I also don't get much of a chance to play around with random modern web technologies, so it was pretty fun to get to use alpine.js for probably the only time in my life.
