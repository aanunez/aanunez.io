                <div class="card-header text-white fw-bold bg-primary bg-gradient">Purpose</div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    The Report Tweaks external module allows end-users to apply a variety of tweaks to individual reports from the "Edit Report" page. These tweaks currently include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Include/Exclude the <code>redcap_event_name</code> from the report. Useful for styling the report for smaller screens if the column isn't needed. </li>
                        <li>Combine (merge) rows representing the same record on the report. </li>
                        <li>Remove rows with no data. Useful if your report filtering occasionally returns blank rows. Using this feature as a replacement for all event filtering should be discouraged as it will slow down very large reports.</li>
                        <li>Add a "writeback" button to the report. </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card m-4">
                <div class="card-header text-white fw-bold bg-secondary bg-gradient">Prerequisites</div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    Using this EM requires <b>no</b> special knowledge, changes to your project settings, or intervention by administrators. The EM can be fully configured with only access to Edit Reports.

                All configuration for Report Tweaks is controlled on the Edit Report page, just below the "Additional Report Options" section. Settings can be enabled or disabled by any user able to access this page. As with changes to any other report setting you will need to click "Save Report" after changing any settings for Report Tweaks. By default new reports will have the "Include redcap_event_name in the report" box checked as this is typical REDCap behaviour. It should be noted that new reports cannot immediately have their Report Tweaks settings changed and must first be saved so a Report ID can be assigned by REDCap.

                <div class="card-body">
                Rows will be merged when both share a common <code>record_id</code> and are, excluding REDCap generated columns, disjoint. This is most common when data is pulled from two different forms on separate events. This feature is not helpful for removing many rows returned from the same repeating instance as those rows will likely have many of the same data points (i.e. have data in the same column).

Settings for the writeback feature can be enabled by checking the box next to the feature and edited by clicking the "configure" button. That value could be static (i.e. set only in the Edit Report screen), determined by the user when they click the writeback button, or the current date.</p><p>Helpful FYIs<ul><li>The user that clicks the writeback button will need to have appropriate permissions to write to the target field</li> <li>The target field need not be listed on the report</li><li>Incrementing a write value is only supported for dates and integers</li><li>Footer, message, and button text are all HTML enabled</li><li>We can still pull the even name from the report if it is hidden by Report Tweaks</li></p>
