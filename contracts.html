                        My code is live in over 2000 production research projects at over 100
                        Universities. I've
                        developed numerous plugins and modules for REDCap, enhancements to related data
                        capturesystems,
                        performed database migrations, and led technical integrations. I'm a major
                        contributor to
                        enterprise and startup codebases, leading the implementation of major product

                            soon, so various mock instruments were created that would be practicle for reuse in the near

                            A substantial amount of data cleanup was needed for an ongoing multi-site project. Working
                            with other technical users I developed a data management plan involving both REDCap
                            configuration for data validation rules, updates to field type validation, and custom data
                            entry triggers to drastically improve data integrity. I then designed and documented various
                            data migrations to resolve issues with existing data. This was done with no interruptions to
                            normal data collection procedures and no major workflow changes.

                            Researchers at the Schwarze Lab needed a high level summary of progress for a major study
                            underway. The summary needed to have limited access, but be external to REDCap as many of
                            those who would be viewing it were removed to the data collection process. I worked to
                            secure a server and design a bespoke project dashboard from scratch that captured all
                            desired information, quickly iterating on my initial design when told that additional
                            information would be needed. The majority of work was completed in only a week, with
                            iternations taking place over the rest of the month.

                            When initially joining the Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (CTRI), a REDCap
                            install had just been completed and their team was looking to establish a standard procedure
                            for launching studies. I was responsible for establishing this process, resolving technical
                            issues that had not been sorted out during REDCap's install, and scoping out customizations
                            that our users would need. To meet the center's needs, I developed a number of external
                            modules and plugins for REDCap. After successfully launching several major studies over the
                            course of three years I transitioned to a part time role where I continue to support the
                            launch of new studies, maintain existing studies, and monitor our external modules for any
                            issues.
